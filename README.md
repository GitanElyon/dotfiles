# OVERVIEW
This repository contains my dotfiles and configuration files for various appli;cations and tools I use on my system. The goal is to keep everything organized and easily manageable.

# STOW
I use GNU Stow to manage my dotfiles. It allows me to keep my dotfiles in a single repository and symlink them into the appropriate locations in my home directory.

I won't go into detail about how to use Stow, but you can find the documentation [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html).
